<h2> Hey, my name is Jose! </h2>
<p> I am from Cochabamba, Bolivia (EST Timezone).
<p/>Bolivia is a country with an <a href="https://www.boliviabella.com/bolivia-cultures.html">extraordinary culture</a>, 
<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/bolivia"> superlative landscapes</a>, 
<a href="https://www.chefspencil.com/top-25-bolivian-foods-best-bolivian-dishes/">delicious food </a> 
and top talented <b>Software Engineers</b>.</p>
<p> I'm a true believer that a good work-life balance is the key to be successful, and certainly this is the reason I still enjoy this profession as the first day.
